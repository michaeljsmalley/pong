##Introduction
I'm trying to pump up my C development chops by writing a Pong clone using ncurses rather than 
raster/vector graphics, which can come later.

##Requirements
All development is done on an Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit machine with the ncurses libraries installed.
The code will not compile without ncurses.

To install ncurses libraries on Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
```
##To Compile and Run
```bash
make all
./main
```
